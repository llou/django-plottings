# django-plottings

A library to generate Matplotlib graphics within Django applications.

The library provides three different ways to use the rendered graphics: 

 - as a view to be viewed or included in a webpage
 - as a text variable to be rendered within a webpage 
 - as a file to be saved in a media directory

This project is under active development.
